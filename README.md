Quick one component prototype

## Libraries:

- Create React App 2 (dev/build tools)
- React 16.7-alpha (try hooks)
- Bootstrap 4 (CSS)
- axios (http)

## Categories:

- Can't be called from client
- Fields can't be filter
- Change rarely

So categories and all available languages are update via update-categories.js script and import in bundle

## Predictions:

Made by another [api](http://robotoff.bournhonesque.eu/api/v1/categories/predictions)
